                <ul class="list">
                    <li><b>1914</b><span> - Born in Cresco, lowa</span><br></li>
                    <li><b>1933</b><span> - Leaves his family's farm to 
                        attend the University of Minnesota, 
                        thanks to a Depression era program 
                        known as the "National Youth 
                        Administration"</span><br></li>
                    <li><b>1935</b><span> - Has to stop school and save up more money. 
                            Works in the Civilian Conservation Corps, 
                            helping starving Americans. "I saw how food 
                            changed them", he said. "All of this left 
                            scars on me."</span><br></li>
                    <li><b>1937</b><span> - Finishes university and 
                        takes a job in the US Forestry Service</span><br></li>
                    <li><b>1938</b><span> - Marries wife of 
                        69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to 
                        budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, 
                        he returns to school study under Stakman, 
                        who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent 
                        plants.</span><br></li>
                    <li><b>1941</b><span> - Tries to enroll in the military after 
                        the Pearl Harbor attack, but is rejected. 
                        Instead, the military asked his lab to work 
                        on waterproof glue, DDT to control malaria, 
                        disinfectants, and other 
                        applied science.</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1944</b><span> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his pregnant wife, 
                         and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology program. 
                         Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 
                         6,000 different strains of disease resistent wheat - 
                         including different varieties for each major 
                         climate on Earth.</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1945</b><span> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season, 
                         doubling wheat yields</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1953</b><span> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf 
                         breed of wheat with a high-yeidling American breed, 
                         creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. 
                         It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1962</b><span> - Visits Delhi and brings 
                         his high-yielding strains of wheat to the 
                         Indian subcontinent in time to help 
                         mitigate mass starvation due to a 
                         rapidly expanding population</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1970</b><span> - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1983</b><span> - helps seven African
                         countries dramatically increase their 
                         maize and sorghum yields</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>1984</b><span> - becomes a distinguished 
                         professor at Texas A&M University</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>2005</b><span> -  states "we will have to double the 
                         world food supply by 2050." 
                         Argues that genetically modified 
                         crops are the only way we can meet the demand, 
                         as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently 
                         dangerous because "we've been 
                         genetically modifying plants and 
                         animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, 
                         people were selecting the best breeds."</span><br></li>
                     <li><b>2009</b><span> - dies at the age of 95.</span><br><br><br></li>
